🚀 Estimation of Position and Velocity of Unmanned Vehicles Using UWB Technology with Deep Learning

This project explores a deep learning–based localization system designed to estimate the position and velocity of an unmanned vehicle using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) distance measurements.
The system combines:

A synthetic UWB simulation environment

Sliding-window time-series preprocessing

A multi-layer LSTM neural network

Optional Kalman Filter baseline comparison

Trajectory and velocity-field visualizations

The aim is to present a robust, high-resolution indoor localization method suitable for environments where GPS is unreliable or unavailable.
